# Logistics Python Tools 🚛🐍

> **Efficiency through Code.**
> A collection of Python scripts and data analysis tools to optimize supply chain processes and automate manual tasks.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository serves as a **toolbox** for modern logistics challenges. It bridges the gap between operational logistics knowledge (SZR liability, customs processes) and data engineering (Python, Pandas, SQL).

The goal is to move from reactive "firefighting" to proactive **systematic optimization** by leveraging data.

## 🛠️ The Tools

This repository is organized into specific modules:

| Tool | Description | Stack | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[SDR Calculator](./szr_calculator)** | Automates liability calculations based on CMR/SZR regulations. Compares weight-based liability vs. goods value to identify insurance risks. | `Python`, `Pandas` | ✅ Completed (v1.0) |
| **[Data Cleaning Pipeline](./data_cleaning)** | A robust ETL script to clean "dirty" logistics data (e.g., fixing formats, handling missing values, standardizing units) using RegEx and Pandas. | `Python`, `RegEx` | ✅ Completed (v1.0) |
| **[Supply Chain Dashboard](./dashboard)** | An interactive dashboard to visualize key supply chain metrics like delivery times and carrier performance. | `Python`, `Streamlit`, `Plotly` | ✅ Completed (v1.0) |

## 🚀 Key Features & Philosophy

* **First-Principles Thinking:** Tools are built based on understanding the *root cause* of logistics problems, not just symptoms.
* **Automation:** Reducing manual effort and human error in repetitive data tasks.
* **Data Quality:** A strong focus on sanitizing inputs to ensure reliable outputs ("Garbage In, Garbage Out").
